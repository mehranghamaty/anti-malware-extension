# Anti-malware application.

At the moment it consists of a chrome extension (front end)which can encrypt files and send them to an external server.

## TODO

1. Loading bar on the chrome extension.
2. Enable fHE on chrome extension. (adds having to have a custom ML solution which you would have to pay me for)
3. Password protect the dashboard.
4. Prevent duplicate cards from being displayed.

## Goals

### For launch

Here would be the goals for getting the application launched.

* To demonstrate ability to create Full-Stack applications and have knowledge and ability to use machine learning in the setting of systems programming.
* To get more familiar with templates in Flask.
* To get more comfortable manipulating dom items in JavaScript.
* To have a base set of scripts of use with traditional Machine Learning Tools.
* To add the ability to have methods for logging in with Flask.
* Gain expose to machine learning while preserving privacy

### Long term

If we see success these are going to be where I would spend more time on getting improvements. Since at the moment, 
the goal would be to have something to show people and demostrate skills, next steps would be getting the application
actually useful tool for people to actively incorporate into a security model. 

* Gain more exposure to scanning different types of files (only exes are supported at the moment).
    * docs
    * pdfs
* Improve accuracies (after getting some other basic models working)
* Have some form of scanning type solution. 

Lets see if I can integrate https://github.com/mitre/multiscanner

## Potential Issue

Okay so it seems like trying to download external dependencies from chrome extensions isn't going to happen.
