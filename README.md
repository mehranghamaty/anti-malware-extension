A monorepo for an anti-malware application.

At the moment it consists of a chrome extension (front end)which can encrypt files and send them to an external server (in this case there are currently two, one written in JS and one written in python). This has to do with knowing that getting encrypted data working will be difficult ideally I would like to use python for now. 

If somebody was paying me and gave me access to getting these things to work with Java (cough cough Google), that would be better.

There are several folders for experimenting with machine learning for malware (VirusMNIST) data processing (SimpleLookUp) and performing ML on encrypted data (SecureML).

Those three have to be put together in order to have a working demo.
