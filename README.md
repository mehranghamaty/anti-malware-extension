# A monorepo for an anti-malware application.

At the moment it consists of a chrome extension (front end)which can encrypt files and send them to an external server (in this case there are currently two, one written in JS and one written in python). This has to do with knowing that getting encrypted data working will be difficult ideally I would like to use python for now. 

## TODO

1. Loading bar on the chrome extension.
2. Enable fHE on chrome extension.
3. Password protect the dashboard.
4. Prevent duplicate cards from being displayed.
5. Cache can be wonky with duplicate file names (move to md5 hashes or something).
6. Redis docker opens port to entire internet (limit to internal network).
7. Try and get the entire thing to work from just a single yaml or better yet with GitHub actions.

## Goal

To demonstrate ability to create Full-Stack applications and have knowledge and ability to use machine learning in the 
setting of systems programming.

## Potential Issue

Okay so it seems like trying to download external dependencies from chrome extensions isn't going to happen.
