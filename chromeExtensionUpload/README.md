

## Requirements

```
    npm install -g browserify
    npm install node-seal
    npm install browser-resolve
    npm install esmify --save-dev
```

## to run 

```
    browserify main.js -p esmify > bundle.js
```

moved to use esbuild

```
 .\node_modules\.bin\esbuild main.js --bundle --platform=node --outfile=bundle.js
```

## To do

have to package it such that it would be obfuscated

## Usability

* if the intent would be to protect end users, then why would you have to upload files (after downloading them). Can I do this on download links?

* Should I even have to send data to external sources?

# For sending out

```
    npm install --save-dev javascript-obfuscator
```

Keep in mind that doesn't produce workable code due to not supporting promises.
