

## Requirements

```
    npm install -g browserify
    npm install node-seal
    npm install browser-resolve
    npm install esmify --save-dev
```

## to run 

```
    browserify main.js -p esmify > bundle.js
```

## To do

have to package it such that it would be obfuscated

## Usability

* if the intent would be to protect end users, then why would you have to upload files (after downloading them). Can I do this on download links?

* Should I even have to send data to external sources?

## for deliverability

```
    npm install --save-dev javascript-obfuscator
```
Did not have much luck with getting that to work with promises

Remove unused dpeendencies
```
    npx depcheck
```
have to keep esmify and browserify for packaging


```
    zip fileUpload.zip assets/ node_modules/ styles/ bundle.js hello.html manifest.json
```

1. migrate to DocumentFragments from templates

2. have the uploadbox change colors on hover,

3. add progress bar
